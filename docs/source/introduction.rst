Introduction
============

Welcome to our **DDCore** - a robust and user-friendly web interface designed to give organizations full control over their own telephony systems. Each domain on our platform operates independently, allowing users to manage their own *extensions*, *users*, *ring groups*, *IVR menus*, *Call Details Record* and more. 

We have implemented a role-based access control system to ensure that each user has access to the appropriate tools and features:

* **Superadmin**: Reserved for our core team, superadmins have unrestricted access to all pages and configurations across all domains.

* **Admin**: Admins have broad access within their assigned domain, allowing them to manage most telephony settings, except for a few restricted sections.

* **User**: Designed for end users, this role provides access to two essential pages, offering a simplified interface for basic operations.
